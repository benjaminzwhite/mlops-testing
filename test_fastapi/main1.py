When creating path operations, you may find situations where you have a fixed path, like /users/me.
Letâ€™s say that itâ€™s to get data about the current user.
You might also have the path /users/{user_id} to get data about a specific user by some user ID.

Because path operations are evaluated in order, you need to make sure that the path for /users/me is declared
before the one for /users/{user_id}:
